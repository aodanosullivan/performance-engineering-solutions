## Aodan O’Sullivan

I have been working in the Performance Engineering industry since 2000. I have been privileged to work with some amazing engineers and I have a constant thirst for knowledge. I believe every day is a school day. I am a big fan of open source and linux. My scripting language of choice is Python.

### Why am I writing this blog?
Along with my thirst for knowledge, I also have a passion for training others. A Performance Engineer should have a wide range of knowledge covering OS systems, scripting, JVM internals, statistics, DBs, visualization and reporting. I’m not claiming to be an expert in all these areas but I can give junior Performance Engineers a good base to build on. I will also have several guest writers throughout this blog.


### Donate

Donations I don't have the finances at the moment to properly show everything I know, so if you would like to donate I promise to use all donations for the betterment of Performance Engineering, such as AWS instances to demo running under high load, etc.
