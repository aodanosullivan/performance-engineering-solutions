I have been working in the Performance Engineering industry since 2000. I have been privileged to work with some amazing engineers and I have a constant thirst for knowledge. I believe every day is a school day. I am a big fan of open source and linux. My scripting language of choice is Python.

Along with my thirst for knowledge, I also have a passion for training others. A Performance Engineer should have a wide range of knowledge covering OS systems, scripting, JVM internals, statistics, DBs, visualization and reporting. Iâ€™m not claiming to be an expert in all these areas but I can give junior Performance Engineers a good base to build on. I will also have several guest writers throughout this blog.

I work on performance testing for over a decade now. Mostly on test design and result analysis. I use JMeter as main load driver and have a chance to play with many aspects related to it. Other areas of intrest are: flux queries, grafana dashboards, overall test debug and issue tracking and analysis.
